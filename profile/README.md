## Welcome to Djinn Tech Repo 👋

🙋‍♀️ Introduction

Djinn is a volumetrics-as-a-service platform that will provide easy access to a diverse range of volumetric sensors, capable of providing real-time streaming, capturing, and playback of point-cloud data. The core concept is to empower everyone to be able to leverage volumetric sensors for a wide variety of use cases, from live streaming to virtual production.

👩‍💻 Project Repos

 - SpatialScan3D: A custom application developed to demonstrate the core capabilities of the Oak-D sensor. It also demonstrates AI-driven markerless camera sync.
 - SpatialScan3D-GUI: The custom interface for the SpatialScan3D application.
